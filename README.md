# RISE Proposal
### Author: Zachary Alan Stuck

This repository contains the scripts used for preliminary data collection used to determine the feasibility of the proposal's scope: **Ontological Security in Online Extremist Communities**

Currently, a script runs every day at 12:00 to gather comments and threads from 4Chan/pol/, a well know source of online hate speech and far-right extremism. As of submission, over **570,000** comments and over **11,000** threads have been collected and stored for analysis. Future aims of this project include the creation of a database for the storage and archiving of commentary in online communities to be used by academic research.

If you are interested in the data or scripts, all data can be found in `src/data`, the main script can be found at `src/main.py`, and the modules used can be found at `src/tasks`.
